# in this file we will learn about comparing lists
# we have two ways to compare lists
# one is 'is'    second in '=='

s1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
s2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']

print(s1 is s2)# it will print true, but if we use 'is' it will be false
# it has to be exact same even the position of the elements if we want to print true by using equals


# now let's use 'is'
a1 = [1,2,3,4]
a2 = [1,2,3,4]
print(a1 is a2)# it will print false
