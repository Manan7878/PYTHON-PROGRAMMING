l = [[1,2,3], [1,2,3], [1,2,3]]
'''
so now what we have to do is
create a list in which we will append list
the list which we will append should contain numbers 1,2,3
'''

l2 = [ [i for i in range(1,4)] for j in range(3) ]
'''
what we did is :
we generated a list from range 1 to 3
then we appended it 3 times
