'''
 in this file we will study about lists
 we can make lists in python by using square brackets
 lists can contain strings, integers or float value (eg. 4.21, 3.1 etc) at the same time
 lists have to be stored in a variable
 eg.
'''
list1 = ['manan', 14, 37.234]

# we can print the whole list by recalling the variable of the list in the print function
print(list1)

print('<----------------------------->')

# we can also access a particular file by accessing its position
print(list1[0])

print('<-------------------------------------->')

# we can also use slicing it's just like using range function 
print(list1[0:2])

print('<---------------------------------->')

# or we can skip some items in the list
print(list1[0:5:2])# we have not filled the first place so it will print from starting

print('<---------------------------------->')
