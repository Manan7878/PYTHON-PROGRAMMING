# if we want to print escape characters as normal text 
# we want the output : abcd \n efgh
# there are two ways


#1st way
'''
what we can do is type on more backslash before the backslash n or backslash t
so the python iterpreter will take it as single backslash
'''
print('line1 \\n line2')


# if you want to print 2 backslash than you have to type 4 backslash
# if you want to print 4 backslash than you have to type 8 backslash
print('this is 4 backslash\\\\\\\\')
