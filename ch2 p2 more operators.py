# there are more operators like equals to like addition subtraction and multiplication
name = 'manan'
# the variable contains a string 'manan' we can not change it by writing codes further but we can print it with changes like
name = 'manan' + ' sharma'
# so it will print manan with sharma
print(name)
# every line of coding in which operators or functions are used is a statement
# if you want to give space between manan and sharma so you click spacebar after manan or in the starting of sharma
a = 2 
b = 9
# for multi plication we use * mark
print(a*b)
# the answer will be the product of a and b
