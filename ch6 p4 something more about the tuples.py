# somethings more about tuples
# we can make a tuple with range function also
nums = tuple(range(1,11))
# now the tuple nums has integers from 1 to 10


# we can change a tuple into a list 
nums = list(nums)
# so now the tuple is now a list and stored in the variable nums

# we can also change a tuple into a string
nums = str(nums)# now it's a string
# but it does not print like a string but it is you can check by type
