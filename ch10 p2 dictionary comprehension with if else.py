'''for if else in dictionary comprehension we will take the example of even and odd numbers'''
'''with the range of 1 to 10'''
oddeven = {i:('even' if i%2==0 else 'odd') for i in range(1,11)}
'''

first we typed the key which will be a integer
then in bracket we have to type for if else in dictionary comprehension
then outside the brackets we ran the for loop
